# acousticTS

Acoustic backscatter from a single target or organism is expressed as
the intensity of an echo typically denoted as the *backscattering
cross-section* (σ~bs~, m^2^). Target strength (TS, dB re. 1 m^2^) is the
logarithmic representation of σ~bs~ where: TS = 10 log~10~ (σ~bs~). TS
can be used to convert integrated (e.g. nautical area scattering
coefficient, S~A~, dB re. 1(m^2^ nmi^-2^) or volumetric backscatter
(e.g. S~v~, dB re. 1 m^-1^) collected from fisheries acoustic surveys
into units of number density, such as the volumetric density of a fish
school (i.e. animals m^-3^). This parameter can also aid in classifying
backscatter based on the multifrequency response of targets, such as
separating likely echoes of large predatory fish from smaller prey.
While there are several approaches for estimating TS, one common method
is to apply physics-based models to predict theoretical TS that comprise
exact and approximate solutions. The models provided in the `acousticTS`
package can help provide TS estimates parameterized using broad
statitsical distributions of inputs. This package is in a constant state
of development with updates to the available model library,
computational efficiency, and quality-of-life improvements.
