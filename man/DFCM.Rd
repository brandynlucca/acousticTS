\title{Calculates the theoretical TS of a fluid-filled scatterer at a given frequency using the deformed finite cylinder model (DFCM).}
\usage{
DFCM(shape = NULL, L = max(shape@rpos[, 1]), a = max(shape@a),
  g = shape@g, h = shape@h, pc = shape@pc,
  numdiv = length(shape@rpos[1, ]), theta = shape@theta, cm = 1500,
  pm = 1.025, frequency, alpha = 0.8, method = "two-ray")
}
\arguments{
\item{shape}{Desired object/animal shape. Must be class "FFS".}

\item{L}{Maximum length (m) of the scatterer. Can either be provided by shape input, or a manual value.}

\item{a}{Maximum radius (m) of the scatterer. Can either be provided by shape input, or a manual value.}

\item{g}{Density contrast (g) of the scatterer. Can either be provided by shape input, or a manual value.}

\item{h}{Sound speed contrast (h) of the scatterer. Can either be provided by shape input, or a manual value.}

\item{pc}{Radius of curvature (m) of the scatterer. Can either be provided by shape input, or a manual value.}

\item{numdiv}{Number of divisions to partition the animal shape into.
Can either be provided by the length of the shape position vector, or a manual value.}

\item{theta}{Orientation (radians).}

\item{cm}{Sound speed of surrounding medium (m/s). Default value is 1500 m/s.}

\item{pm}{Density of surrounding medium (kg/m^3). Default value 1.025 kg/m^3.}

\item{frequency}{Frequency (Hz).}

\item{alpha}{Numerically derived coefficient (\eqn{\alpha_\beta}). Default is 0.8, and is the suggested value.}

\item{method}{Currently only the two-ray method is available, but the six-ray and other formulations will be available in the future.}
