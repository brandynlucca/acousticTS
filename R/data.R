#' Sample krill shape taken from McGehee et al. (1998)
#'
#' A dataset containing a sample krill (Euphausia superba) body shape proposed
#'  by McGehee et al. (1998).
#'
#' @format A FFS object comprising all information required for target strength modelling. The variables are as follows:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{rpos}{Position matrix ([x,y,z], m)[0.0410898,0.0000000,0.0000000] to [0.0000000,0.0000000,0.003815]}
#'   \item{a}{Radius vector (m) (0.0000000 to 0.0005946)}
#'   \item{g}{Density contrast (1.0357)}
#'   \item{h}{Soundspeed contrast (1.0279)}
#'   \item{theta}{Orientation (degrees) (pi/2, or ~1.570796)}
#'   \item{shape}{Body curvature (straight)}
