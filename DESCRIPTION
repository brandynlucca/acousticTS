Description: Acoustic target strength (TS) represents the intensity of an
    echo returning from an individual scatterer such as bubbles, fish, or
    zooplankton. TS can be used to convert integrated or volumetric
    backscatter collected from fisheries acoustic surveys into units of
    number density (e.g. animals per m^3), abundance (e.g. number of
    animals), and biomass (e.g. kg). This parameter can also be used to
    aid in classifying backscatter, such as separating likely echoes of
    large predatory fish (e.g. adult cod) from smaller prey (e.g. shrimp).
    One way to estimate TS is to use physics-based models to calculate
    theoretical TS that comprise exact and approximate solutions as well
    as analytical approaches. The models provided can help provide TS
    estimates over broad statistical distirbutions of model parameters.
